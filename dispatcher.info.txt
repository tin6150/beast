# dispatcher.sh is container entrypoint to invoke desired binary
# doesn't seems to work, likely cuz singularity itself is a wrapper and 
# the param get hidden deep into the many layers of the onion rather than being $0
# use $SINGULARITY_NAME

# test with this:


ProgName=dispatcher.sh
ProgName=phylotool.sif
ln -s $ProgName mb
ln -s $ProgName mafft
ln -s $ProgName tree-puzzle
ln -s $ProgName metaphlan2
